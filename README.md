### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow



### What I learned

I struggled with the CSS a bit on this one, more so with the positioning of the overlapping images. Making this mobile friendly was also a challenge with the same positioning issues I had. 



### Continued development

I feel like the CSS could be more concise, its something I will revisit again once I get more CSS under my belt.
